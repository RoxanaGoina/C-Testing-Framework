# C-Testing-Framework

The application allows checking files with the .c extension. 
The  framework is able to identify C source code, from a given folder structure.
The resulting executables are saved in an Output folder, in the same folder with the source codes. 
The Framework  also tests the execution correctness of the resulting programs by checking the exit code and the output against existing check files.
